# Memory Operations

## Short-Term
- Session scratchpad (CEP primer, active project status).
- Project notes injected at the start of each session.

## Working Memory Files
- `project_log.json`: Tracks tasks, notes, and status.
- `last_opened_files.json`: Tracks files and contexts in VS Code.

## Long-Term
- Summaries of completed work stored in `/memory/`.
- Decisions/standards logged for recall in future sessions.

## Guidelines
- Jenny: Summarize context at session start.
- Claude: Accept injected summaries as authoritative.
